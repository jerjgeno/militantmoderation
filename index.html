	<b><div id="indexbluegreenboxb"><span class="yellowbackground"><A HREF="#yellowblackborderb">PART B -- * WHAT IS MILITANT MODERATION? *</A></b></span></div>

</div>



<center><b><div id="yellowblackborder">PART A --  WHY IS EXTREMISM SO POPULAR AND POWERFUL?</b></div></center></p>



<div align="justify"><p>Naturally, most people love <span class ="red"><b> the SIMPLICITY, the CERTAINTY, and <u>THE SHORT-TERM BENEFITS</u> offered by EXTREMIST BELIEFS.</b> </span> And naturally, few people love MODERATION (with its strict Responsibilities and Limits, <span class="blue"><b>which are designed to reward people <u>IN THE FAR-DISTANT FUTURE</u>).</b></span> Especially during Rapidly Changing Times, <span class="blue"><b> Most People are too busy to worry about events that might happen <u>AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME</u></b></span> (like Global Warming or antibiotic-resistant germs).</p></div>

<div align="justify"><p><span class ="red"><b>In the Real World, EXTREMISM IS <u>ALWAYS</u> EXCITING AND INNOVATIVE!</b> </span> Most movies and books are about Extremists.  You will never see a great book or movie about Moderate People; <span class="blue"><b>that would be TOO BORING!</b> </span> And because Moderate people assume that there’s <u>Some Truth</u> on almost all sides of every debate, a serious debate among Moderate people will usually end-up with everyone talking in circles.  So, it’s always difficult to justify that there’s something good about Moderation.  Even those who believe that Moderation is THE BEST Way of Life have not been able to justify that claim for us!
<span class="blue"><b>(As evidenced by our current dictionary definitions, saying that Moderate people are “mediocre, slow in thought, indecisive, and <u>LACKING ANY FIRM BELIEFS”</u>).</b></span></p></div>
<center>---------------------------------------------</center>
<div align="justify"><p>Also, if you are a parent, teacher, boss, politician, OR AN EXPERT ON ANY SUBJECT, you must be fully aware of <b><u>THESE THREE FACTS:</u></b></p>
<ul>
<li>		<b>If you express ANY doubts about something, <span class ="red">PEOPLE WILL BE <u>LESS LIKELY TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING,</u> and you could lose all your future effectiveness . . .  </span></b></li>
<br>
<li>		When you say something WITH TOTAL CERTAINTY (or quote  the words of a respected Authoritarian Leader, or God), <span class ="red"><b>PEOPLE WILL BE <u>MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING,</u> and you retain your value, as a good leader (or teacher) . . .</b></span></li>
<br>
<li>	AND WHEN YOU SPECIFY THAT YOU ARE ONLY REPEATING WHAT AN AUTHORITY FIGURE SAYS (OR WHAT GOD WISHES), <span class ="red"><b><u>ANYTHING YOU SAY OR DO</u> (EVEN THOUGH IT COULD DESTROY LIVES, OR KILL PEOPLE), CAN EASILY BE JUSTIFIED AS RIGHTEOUS, MORAL, AND TOTALLY TRUE . . .</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>If your beliefs are backed-up by YOUR Total Certainty (or, What God Truly Wants), <u>WHO CAN PROVE THAT YOU ARE WRONG</u>? NO ONE!   (And that’s why Charlatans are so successful.)</p>
<p><center><b>UNFORTUNATELY, EXTREMISM HAS NOW BECOME <u>OUR MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM</u>!</b></center></p></div>
  
<div align="justify"><p><span class ="red"><b>BY DEFINITION, EXTREMISTS HAVE ONLY <u>ONE OVERWHELMING FEAR</u>, ONLY ONE IMPORTANT NEED, AND ONLY ONE MOTIVATIONAL GOAL.  So they believe that they know what is best FOR <u>ALL</u> PEOPLE, <u>FOR ETERNITY</u> (and they know this, <u>WITH TOTAL CERTAINTY</u>)!  As a result, EXTREMISM IS USUALLY EXCITING, POPULAR, AND <u>VERY POWERFUL</u>.</b> </span> HOWEVER, EXTREMISM OFTEN LEADS TO CHAOS (because those who continually pursue all the far-out Excesses and Extremes of One Extreme usually end-up WILLING TO DIE FOR THEIR BELIEFS, or even, <u>WILLING TO KILL OTHER PEOPLE</u> FOR THEIR BELIEFS)!</p></div>

<div align="justify"><p><span class ="blue"><b>A MODERATE PERSON HAS TWO OR MORE FEARS, TWO OR MORE IMPORTANT NEEDS, AND TWO OR MORE FAVORITE GOALS!  SO MODERATE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT NO HUMAN ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT IS BEST FOR ALL PEOPLE, Eternally.</b></span>  WHY?  BECAUSE THE TIMES KEEP CHANGING!  Over a long Period of Time, there is some potential GOOD and some potential BAD in <u>EVERYTHING</u> that humans can Think and Do.  And nothing is Free! <span class ="blue"> <b>Thus, Moderate people tend to be more Open-Minded, Adaptable, and Balanced. But they remain <u>UN</u>CERTAIN about most things;</b></span> and as a result, our dictionaries now define all Moderate people as “Mediocre, indecisive, slow in thought, AND <u>WITHOUT ANY FIRM BELIEFS”</u> . . .
 </p></div>
<p><center><b>WITH THAT DEFINITION, WHO WANTS TO BE MODERATE?</b></center></p>

<center>---------------------------------------------</center>

<div align="justify"><p><b>Therefore, we will assume that both Extremism and Moderation are EQUALLY GOOD (but at different periods of time, and when we are faced with unusual situations). <span class ="blue"> <b>During <u>GOOD TIMES</u> (and especially, within Free-Willed democracies), Open-Minded MODERATION IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR ACHIEVING GOOD LONG-TERM END-RESULTS. </b></span> <span class ="red"><b>However, DURING <u>BAD TIMES</u> (and especially, within Authoritarian Societies, dictatorships, and religious cults), EXTREMISM IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO PURSUE TOTAL PERFECTION, <u>FOR ETERNITY</u>. . . </b></span> <b>NOW, THAT’S WHAT EXTREMISM IS ALL ABOUT!</b></b></p></div>

<div align="justify"><p><b>And if you have ever argued with an <u>UN</u>REASONABLE Person (or an <u>Un</u>reasonable Spouse), you know that <u>THE MOST UNREASONABLE EXTREMIST WILL ALWAYS WIN THOSE ARGUMENTS</u> . . .
(Thats why <u>Un</u>reasonable Extremists love to argue, just for the sake of arguing, with no other purpose.)</b></p></div>

<center><b><div id="yellowsansborder"><p style="font-size: 20px">BUT WHY DO EXTREMISTS <u>ALWAYS WIN?</u></div></b></center></p>
<ol>
<li>	<div align="justify"><b>BECAUSE NO ONE CAN ARGUE WITH A PERSON WHO HAS “TOTAL CERTAINTY ABOUT <u>EVERYTHING</u>”. </b> As best we know, FEW (or NO) Beliefs are Totally True, or Totally False. <b> Most Beliefs are actually Partially-True and Partially-False (because in Real Life, Almost Everything <u>CAN CHANGE</u>)!</b></li></div>
<br>
<li>	<div align="justify"><b>BECAUSE MANY ASPECTS OF LIFE ARE <u>NOT SIMPLE</u>!</b>  In Real Life, many things are Complex, Confusing, Contradictory, or even, beyond Human Comprehension!  As a result, <b>MOST PEOPLE</b> (especially, the <u>un</u>educated people) try to avoid all the difficult Ways of Life, <span class ="green"><b>by always pursuing <u>THE EASIEST WAY OF LIFE</u> (WHICH IS, SPIRITUAL “<u>OTHER-WORLDLY EXTREMISM</u>”, with its abstract-emotional <u>Half-Truths</u>, FATALISM, INNER PEACE OF MIND, AND TOTAL CERTAINTY ABOUT EVERYTHING).</b></span></li></div>

<br><br>

<center><div id="yellowbigblackborder"><b><p>What's better than <u>TOTAL CERTAINTY</u> and <u>PEACE OF MIND</u>, with no Fears or Worries?<br>
<span class ="purple">And again, WHO CAN ARGUE WITH A PERSON, WHO  “<u>KNOWS EVERYTHING</u>”?</span></p></div></b></center>

<br><br>

<li>	<div align="justify"><b><span class ="blue">Because SECULAR-WORLDLY <u>MODERATION</u> (with its <u>UN</u>CERTAINTIES, Multiple Motivational Goals, and NEVER-ENDING WORRIES ABOUT RATIONAL FREE-WILLED DECISION-MAKING) IS <u>NOT EASY</u>. </span><span class="yellowbackground">THEREFORE, <u>MODERATION IS USUALLY HATED</u></span> <span class ="red"> (ESPECIALLY, AMONG <u>UN</u>EDUCATED PEOPLE, SPIRITUAL-RELIGIOUS FANATICS, <u>MOST AUTHORITARIAN LEADERS</u>, AND ALL EXTREMISTS).</b></span></li></b></div>
<br>
<li><div align="justify"><b>Because “REASONABLE PEOPLE” MAKE TWO COLOSSAL MISTAKES IN LIFE.  By continually trying to prove that <u>THEY ARE STILL REASONABLE,</u> Reasonable People must deal with ALL TYPES OF “<u>UN</u>REASONABLE  PEOPLE” <u>IN A SANE AND RATIONAL MANNER</u> . . .  <span class ="red">And then, by assuming that <u>ALL PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY REASONABLE,</u></span> <span class="yellowbackground">REASONABLE PEOPLE MAKE A WORSE MISTAKE!</b></li></span></b></div>

<p><center><span class ="greenbackground"><p style="font-size: 20px"><b>AND WHAT DO MILITANT MODERATES BELIEVE?</b></span></center></p>


<div class id="newphilosophyoflife"><div align="justify"><b>MILITANT MODERATION IS A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE, which teaches “Without ANY Problems in Life, we would all be BORED TO DEATH”. <span class ="red"> THUS, WE NEED SOME PROBLEMS (some Problems and Stresses ARE GOOD </b></span>-- they give us reasons to get out of bed each day, and do something worthwhile).  Especially for a person, who is alive, young, and healthy enough to DEAL with Real Life, <b>most of his Problems are really “NOTAPROBLEM”! </b><b>  <span class ="blue">Almost every Problem in his (or her) life is actually “A CHALLENGE, an important Reason for Living, or a Motivational Goal, designed by God (or Mother Nature) to keep That Person WELL-MOTIVATED TO IMPROVE CERTAIN THINGS ON EARTH”! </span><span class ="red"> (Of course, a Challenge that is TOTALLY IGNORED can easily become A BIG PROBLEM.) </span> Therefore, erase the word “Problem” in all your dictionaries AND REPLACE IT WITH “A CHALLENGE” (which is an Inspirational Word that gives you A BETTER CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN REAL LIFE)!</b></div></b></div>


<p><b><div align="justify">SO DON’T BLAME YOUR CREATOR, MOTHER NATURE, BAD LUCK, SATAN, OR YOUR SPOUSE FOR ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS</b> (or for all of <u>OUR PROBLEMS</u>)! <b> IN TRUTH, IT’S SCREWED-UP PEOPLE<span class ="red"> (I call them “GOALCRAZIES”),</span> WHO TAKE ALL OUR BEST MOTIVATIONAL GOALS (which are designed to IMPROVE life on earth),<span class ="red"> AND MANIPULATE THEM INTO GOOD REASONS FOR DOING <u>THE MOST EXTREME</u>, <u>THE MOST STUPID</u>, OR EVEN, <u>THE MOST BARBARIC DEEDS</u>!</b></span></p></b></div>

<p><div align="justify"><span class ="red"><b>Right now, we really don’t know who our friends are, who our enemies are, or HOW MANY WARS WE ARE ACTUALLY FIGHTING!</span><span class ="blue">  Therefore, it’s now necessary to introduce a new weapon into all the Challenges, Conflicts, and Contradictions we are facing . . .  (And regardless of what you’ve always been told, Open-Minded Moderates living in Free Democracies are NOT WEAK; </span>THEY ACTUALLY POSSESS <u>A SECRET WEAPON</u> (MILITANT MODERATION’S OPEN-MINDED ADAPTABILITY, WHICH COULD BE ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE DURING OUR RAPIDLY CHANGING TIMES) . . .

<p><li>	<u>REMAIN PARTIALLY-COMPETITIVE</u> AND <u>PARTIALLY-COOPERATIVE</u>, WHILE ALSO ACCEPTING CERTAIN LIMITS ON ALL THEIR OTHER BELIEFS AND DEEDS.</p></li>

<p><li>	REMAIN MOTIVATED TO DO WHATEVER WILL MOST-LIKELY WORK WELL.  <span class ="red">And if something DOES NOT WORK WELL, <u>THEY CAN CONVERT SOME OF THEIR FAILURES INTO PARTIAL-SUCCESSES!</u></b></span></p></li>

<center><p style="font-size: 20px"><span class ="red"><b>THIS IS MILITANT MODERATION . . .</span><span class ="purple">  IT COULD CREATE A NEW RENAISSANCE!</b></span></center></p>
</ol>

<center>-------------------------------------------------------------</center>

<p><b><div align="justify"><p style="font-size: 17px">Militant Moderates believe that there is SOME POTENTIAL <u>GOOD</u> AND SOME POTENTIAL BAD IN EVERYTHING, <u>Everything HAS LIMITS</u></b> (or costs),<b><u> Over the Long-Term, NOTHING IS FREE</u>, AND ALL THE EXCESSES AND EXTREMES OF LIFE WILL USUALLY END-UP WITH A <u>BAD</u> END-RESULT  -- <span class ="red">LIKE BEING TOO CAREFREE, </span><span class ="yellow">TOO CAREFUL,</span><span class ="purple"> TOO COOPERATIVE,</span><span class="brown"> TOO COMPETITIVE,</span><span class ="green"> TOO CONTEMPLATIVE,</span><span class ="blue"> OR TOO COMPROMISING </span></b>(leading to five Extreme Philosophies of Life, <u>ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF THOSE FIVE</u>, and Six Types of Mental Illnesses)!  <b>(Please note that I have assigned a different color TO IDENTIFY EACH PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE.)  <span class ="blue">Thus, to remain Rational and Functional during drastically changing times </span></b>(and <u>increase</u> your chances for More Long-Term SUCCESSES), <span class ="blue"><b> YOU MUST REMAIN <u>VERY OPEN-MINDED AND ADAPTABLE</u></b>:</span></p></div>

<ol>
<p><li><div align="justify"><b>During <u>un</u>certain times and drastically changing times</b> (when God and Mother Nature give NO GUARANTEES), the future well-being of YOU, ME, our children, and all Life on Earth are closely tied together.

<p><li><div align="justify"><b>ALSO, DURING SUCH TIMES, YOU MUST BE AWARE OF TWO BASIC TIME-FRAMES, <span class ="red"><u>THE SHORT-TERM</u> (with Extremism, which is designed to be mostly beneficial <u>FOR YOURSELF</u>, for less than 100 years) </span><span class ="blue">AND <u>THE LONG-TERM</u> (with Moderation, which is designed to be mostly beneficial for your Children, for your Social Groups, for your God, for Mother Nature, and for HUMANITY ITSELF, <u>FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS</u>-- even long after your own death)</span> </b>. . .  BY BELIEVING THAT BOTH THE SHORT-TERM (with its EXTREMES) AND THE LONG-TERM (with its MODERATION) <span class ="blue"><b><u>ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND EQUALLY VALUABLE</u> (for dealing with many different situations in Real Life), YOU CAN ACTUALLY BRING MORE FULFILLMENTS AND MANY NEW BENEFITS INTO YOUR LIFE!</span></b></p></span></div>
